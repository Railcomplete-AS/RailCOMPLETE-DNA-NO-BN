RailCOMPLETE sample Definition of Network Assets (DNA) - the Generic Application

The intention behind RailCOMPLETE® is to provide one Generic Product that is the same for all users in the world; yet to allow specialists in each railway market to provide local customization. Railcomplete AS is in the business of selling licenses for the Generic Product and provides this sample DNA - the Generic Application - as free software. The lack of standardization of drawing symbols, tolerances, UML models, calculation methods, etc. in rail infrastructure communities around the world makes it unmanageable for one company to produce and maintain DNAs for all interested infrastructure managers' railway systems. Railcomplete AS welcomes any prospective DNA agent to make his own dedicated DNA and to capitalize on it. 

This Generic Application is free software, protected by the MIT license (ref: SPDX License List entry “MIT”, also known as the “Expat License”). The MIT license grants you access to this Generic Application as executable software running under the Generic Product, RailCOMPLETE. The MIT license also grants you access to source code and documentation. The MIT license grants any DNA agent the right to modify and distribute, on a commercial basis, the Generic Application or parts thereof, provided that the MIT license terms are respected. Contact Railcomplete AS to obtain the source code and its documentation.

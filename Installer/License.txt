      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Font Awesome 4.0


SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE 
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide 
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation 
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and 
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership 
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and 
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The 
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved 
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, 
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The 
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply 
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS 
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright 
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may 
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the 
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as 
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, 
or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the 
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a 
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical 
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS 
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining 
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, 
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font 
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, 
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy 
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be 
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or 
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or 
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font 
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding 
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as 
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font 
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any 
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the 
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written 
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, 
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be 
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to 
remain under this license does not apply to any document created 
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION 
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are 
not met.

DISCLAIMER 
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT 
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING 
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM 
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

It looks like Powershell makes a bad conversion of multibyte UTF-8 encoded characters, but running XPPQ in the Windows CMD shell works fine.

Hi Claude,

You are right - when I run our XML-file through XPPQ, the special Norwegian letters come through unchanged, as they should.

So Eirik / Anders - why do the multibyte UTF-8 characters change when you try the same on your computer? Did you run it using some kind of script on the Build server?

= = > Anders or Eirik: Please check.

U+00C3 U+00B8 which is actually the letters “Ã¸”.

I copy/paste above example in a file and it was correctly handled by XPPq.

I need you to send me a small file with which XPPq has this problem, so I can reproduce it on my computer.

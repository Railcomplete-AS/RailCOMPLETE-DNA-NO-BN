RailCOMPLETE DNA version NO-BN 2023.a
++ Great news!     + Added     - Removed     * Modified     ? Known problem     ! Info

* Fixed bug in _JBTEH_MAS_SpanLengthDisplay2() [np2 => npo2].
* Fixed bug in _JBTSA_SIG_signal_model3DName() [after removing ERTMS as a variant for class-B signals].
* Fixed bug in LuaExpresssion call to NOBN_sig_getSignalPartNames() DNA function from [JBTSA_SIG Signal].IsyPostnotat [missing parenthesis].
* Fixed bug in Lua functions NOBN_sig_getSignalLitra() and NOBN_sig_getSignalLitra() concerning signal object's code property being 'nil'.
* Fixed bad name for function _JBTSA_SIG_signal_model3DName().
* Fixed bad linking of Lua expression for ERTMS ID boards, property Offset3D.Z to the object type.
* Changed the Text Attribute tags in 3D models for ERTMS ID-board E101-E and E101-F from T01 to T04.
* Changed _JBTSA_MSS_E101_Offset3dZ() to use attachment parent's Yokemounted property if possible.
* Fixed issues concerning bad balise relations and bad function _JBTSA_ATC_code().
* Fixed Model3DName formula for JBTSA_ATB legacy balises (NSS, National Signaling System).
* Fixed routing of text to 2D balise symbol from properties TextAbove / TextUnder to the ATTDEF properties 'TEKSTOVER' and 'TEKSTUNDER'.
* Resolved duplicate relation names between ETCS and NSS balise group and related objects.
* Fixed error in 'JBTSA_SPF Sporfelt' - French text has been replaced, delimiter object type has been corrected to "JBTKO_SKJ Skinneskjøt".
+ Added multiple prefab cable lengths to axle counter tuning unit, adjusted the model check formula accordingly. Added flat/upright/wall as its mounting methods.
+ Added 3D models for flat / upright wallmount of "JBTSA_TET Akselteller" tuning unit (type Thales).
* Relation source name for axle counter tuning unit changed from just 'tuningenhet' to 'akselteller_tuningenhet'.
* Connected flat / upright / wallmount FTGS tuning units to new object type "JBTSA_SFT Tuningenhet for FTGS sporfelt".
* Fixed error in 3D model for switch point machines (it selected left side "VSIDE" consequently).
+ Added field 'Banestrekning' to 'Tittelfelt' Bane NOR property set.
* Modified 3D models for "Kabelkanal" so the insertion point is centric on the top of the lid rather than centric at the bottom of the models.
+ Introduced "Kontaktledning, wire" as a new variant for "JBTEH_KTL Kontaktledning". The new continuation item for CW will piece them together from one end (at
  the first wire tension balancer) to the other end (at the second WTB). A correctly configured contact wire will start out as a steel wire
  (dashed line type), continue as a lifted (grooved but non-contact) contact wire (dashed linetype), continue as a grooved contact wire (continuous linetype),
  then continue as a lifed contact wire (dashed linetype) and finally as a steel wire to the second wire tension balancer.
* Changed 'Bæretråd' to 'Bæreline', then changed into "Kontaktledning, ikke kjørbar" as a variant of KBTEH_KTL contact wire.
- Messenger wires, droppers, stich lines, Z-lines are not anymore modeled as semantic objects with RcType. Semantic info should be contained in cantilevers instead.
+ Introduced "JBTEH_FIL Fixline" as a new alignment type. Its relation source space is 'fixline'. It relates to one cantilever, two wire tension balancers, 
  and zero, one or two force transfer consoles 'JBTEH_KPM' (no KPM at a TUF tunnel wall fixation, use KPM if terminated at an OCS pole). It accepts line
  isolators. It does not accept continuation objects, it shall be drawn from end to end between its two wire tension balancers.
* Relation "Utliggerfiksering" now has "fixline" as target space instead of "kl-oppheng".
* The former object type "JBTEH_KLO Kontaktledningsoppheng" has been deprecated. The messenger wire may be modeled in 3D, but not in 2D anymore (not needed).
* The former "Har kl-oppheng" relation is replaced by the relation "Fikseres av fixline" / reverse relation "Fikserer utligger".
* JBTEH_ISO now snaps to alignment types 'JBTEH_KTL Kontaktledning' and to 'JBTEH_FIL Fixline'.
+ Added linear placement methods and modelchecks to the 'JBTEH_ISO Isolator' object.
- Point object JBTEH_AEH does not have variant 'Fixpunkt' anymore.
* 'JBTEH_AEH Avspenning' now snaps to these relation source spaces: kontaktledning/fixline/høyspentledning.
+ Point object 'JBTEH_FIX Fixpunkt' has been added, snapping to track. It relates to its fixline and to the cantilever being fixed.
* Changed 'JBTEH_XBE Beskyttelsesskjerm' into 'JBTEH_ASK Avskjerming'. All associated 2D symbols and 3D files have been renamed accordingly.
* Changed 'JBTEH_KPM Konsoll på pole' into 'JBTEH_KPM Kraftoverføringskonsoll på mast'.
* Renamed old "XX-YYY" style object type abbreviations into "JBTXX_YY" style, which is less prone to copy-paste errors when developing the DNA.
* Updated the OCS support pole table Lua code. Renamed the variants for 'JBTFE_DIV KL-tabell'.
* Fixed many smaller issues concerning Lua formulas for name, code, DistanceToAlignment, RelativeElevation properties which were declared in 
  XML macros as well as directly in XML code.
+ New object type 'JBTEH_LED Ledning'. Various wires for OCS wire system.
+ New object type 'JBTEH_LEF Ledningsfortsettelse'. Continuation for 'JBTEH_LED Ledning'.
+ New object type 'JBTEH_KTF Kontaktledningsfortsettelse'. Continuation for 'JBTEH_KTL Kontaktledning'.
* Refined Lua snippet for property JBTEH_UTL.code, it now copies the pole's code. If two or more cantilevers, it assigns a sub-numbering -1, -2 etc.
* Refined Lua snippet for property JBTEH_AEH.Mileage, it now rotates and snaps to the extremity of its stretcher / spanner alignment.
+ Added Lua snippet for property TargetAlignment in objects JBTKO_SPF, JBTEH_FIL and JBTEH_KTF, they now locate a best guess target alignment.
* Fixed a DistanceToAlignment problem for JBTEH_UTL cantilever objects when it did not belong to the same track as its OCS pole.
* Fixed 2D symbol names for "Veisignal" to JP-JR-2D-JBTSA_SIG-VEISIGNAL-VS1 and JP-JR-2D-JBTSA_SIG-VEISIGNAL-VS2 (they still don't have 3D).
? Object type "Veisignal" still does not have a 3D shape in the 3D library.
*? Fixed horizontal geometry annotation of spirals so the text is perceived correctly when km increases towards right. Still wrong if going left.
* Made more readable relation names (meaningful also when seen as-is, not just in a context where you already know the source object type).
* Fixed buggy sign used for Stagger correction in JBTEH_UTL.WireClampLateralOffset when the pole is located to the right of the track.
+ Added formulas to cantilever such that its 2D symbol's length adapts to stagger and push/pull direction is deduced from three wire clamps.
+ Added text position formulas to JBTEH_AEH object and JBTEH_UTL.
* Renamed text position formula for SPENNLENGDE(2) from '_JBTEH_MAS_SpanLengthTextOffset(2)' to '_JBTEH_MAS_SpanLengthTextPosition(2)'.
+ Added Showlayer items for cantilever stagger text attribute and cantilever's related contact wire text attribute.
* Changed 'suspension mast' into 'droparm' everywhere.
* Repaired Lua formula for triggering modelchecking in its related objects each time an OCS pole, a droparm or a yoke is refreshed.
* 2D symbol for cantilevers: Cantilever system (type) and push/pull variant text has been shrunk and rotated 90 degrees to be less annoying.
* Modified continuation-object modelcheck code, same code snippets now work for EH-ISO, EH-KTF, EH-LEF and KO-SPF.
* Pset Banedata, 'BaneNORFag' now receives the two-letter combination FE,KU,KO,EH,SA,TE,EL instead of the discipline's readable name.
* Fixed error in mileage formula for droparm in OCS galley (hengemast i utliggeråk).
+ Added modelchecking for cantilever sequence. A warning symbolframe appears if it does not have exactly one preceding and one following.
+ The SymbolFrame property now flags an object as unfinished (light blue frame) if any relation's (visible) minimum requirement is violated.
+ Added SymbolFrame and new property "Derogation" to all objects subject to rule checking. States are: Normed, Deviating, Requested, Approved.
+ Added modelchecking to isolated joint 'JBTKO_SKJ Skinneskjøt': Alarm at 23 m between neighboring joints, error at 21 m or below.
* Renamed many modelchecking formulas.
* Corrected error in JBTEH_UTL spanlength / spanlength2 text position formulas.
* Fixed layer color for JBTxx@OBJEKTID text attribute in several object types, set to 'ByLayer' instead of using current COLOR sysvar setting.
* Added TET08 cantilever variant, for use in low-ceiling tunnels.
* Default OCS pole height changed from 8m to 9.5m, plus auto-adjust by its elevation above own alignment. This is consistent with high poles for AT.
* RcType for kontaktledningsbytte has been changed from "JBTEH_DIV Ledningsbytte annotering" to "JBTEH_LBA Ledningsbytte annotering".
* Vector math functions such as getVectorSum() and getVectorCrossproduct() have been moved from DNA to the RailCOMPLETE API (RC v2022.2 and later).
* Switch Variant "1:11,66" has been renamed everywhere to "1:11.66".
* Enhanced the 2D symbol for dual cantilever console. Adjusted distance-to-alignment for dual cantilever console to account for OCS pole width.
  Adjusted distance-to-alignment for cantilever objects to account for the width of the dual-cantilever console object.
* The Train Gauge profile A96T for station / open line had a "hole" in its 2D sweep profile, blocking the sweep, which has now been fixed.
* Renamed 2D symbol block names for JBTEH_KPM into JBTEH_FPM ('Forankring på mast'), renamed -STREVERFESTE- to -STREVER- and -BARDUNFESTE- to -BARDUN-.
* Renamed 3D representation DWG files to reflect changes to 2D symbols concerning KPM into FPM (see above).
* Fixed bug in _JBTEH_STF_Model3DName() where a dash '-' in the Variant:match() search pattern was not escaped as '%-'. Now using '==' instead of match().
+ Added RC__getDnaVersion() which returns "NO-BN-2019.1g" or "NO-BN-2022.a" or "DE-DB-2021.a" etc., extracted from the DWG's DocumentData.DnaIri.
* Extended the visible range for cantilevers, from 1000..6000 mm in steps of 50 mm, to 500.6000 mm in steps of step 10 mm.
* Corrected 3D formula for JBTEH_STF-STREVER-FOTPLATE models.
* "Hengemast i åk type 12" / "Hengemast i åk type 14" / "Hengemast i åk type 40" variants have been collapsed into just "Hengemast i åk".
* Available dimensions for bridge/tunnel and portal droparms are now 100x100, 100x150, 100x200. For bridge/tunnel, Ø120 is also available.
* Droparms for tunnel now feature the bottom lock plate. Droparms for portals now feature top and bottom lock plates.
- The list of enum values for tunnel/bridge droparms has been reduced from 500..5000 (step 50) to 500..5000 (step 250).
- The list of enum values for portal droparms has been reduced from from  500..5000 (step 50)  to 1000..5000 (step 100).

* Renamed property YokeMounted into PortalMounted.
+ Added tutorials using DNA version 2021.a from NO-BN
* Changed all ShowLayer statements with 'ExactMatch' into 'PartialMatch'. This way, similarly named layers in XRefs are always affected.
* Moved property 'description' from category 'General' to 'Generelt'.
* Improved turnout tables, explicitly using the terms 'profilering' for own alignment's mileage, and 'kilometrering' for reference alignment mileage.
+ Added cable trench (kabelgrøft) as 2D sweep profile to KU library folder.
* Changed all occurrences of 'yoke' with 'portal'. Changed all occurrences of (OCS) 'mast' with 'pole'. Signal masts are still called 'masts'.
* Changed all 'OBJEKTINFO' attributes to 'OBJEKTBESKRIVELSE'. Corresponding change introduced in ShowLayer data as well.
++ Introduced ForwardLuaName and ReverseLuaName as alias identifiers for a relation's forward and reverse prompt texts. Works with Lua editor Autofill.
++ Introduced LuaName as an alias for an object type declarations's 'Name' attribute. Works with Lua editor Autofill.
* Interchanged Previous/Next in the relation between cantilevers/WTBs and in the relation between OCS poles (to make the "Previous" request appear first). 
* Changed lantern color in ERTMS shunting signals from "Blue 170" to "White 7".
* Reversed the middle right structure of truss portal Type 12-22-32M, 12-23-33M. Corrected the length of the two middle truss elements for Type 12-08-18M.
+ Added 3D geometry for steel plates shifting an NSI signal mast sideways from its foundation, 130 or 500 millimeters. Added several new NSI signal configurations.
* Changed layer for Sighting Region Annotations Made Permanent from "JBTFE#ANNOTATIONS_SIGHT_AREA" to "JBTFE#ANNOTATIONS_SIGHT_REGION".
* Corrected an error that prevented showing the markerboard's letter and number in the E101-2 two-line identification board.
* Corrected an error in the formula for default ERTMS markerboard sighting distance (testing on deprecated property 'Markerboard' was removed).
* Corrected the naming of repeater groups R-U-V-W-Signal ('R' is the first one in the driving direction). 'W' was added as the fourth possible letter, ref TRV on ATC.
* Corrected an old error in RC__IsMemberOf() which did not treat object references correctly (only number / string items were treated correctly).
* Adapted RC__IsMemberOf() and RC__Identify() to new type classification of RC objects as "userdata" instead of "table". A collection is now "user

RailCOMPLETE DNA version NO-BN 2022.a
++ Great news!     + Added     - Removed     * Modified     ? Known problem     ! Info
* Fixed bug in _JBTEH_MAS_SpanLengthDisplay2() [np2 => npo2].
* Fixed bug in _JBTSA_SIG_signal_model3DName() [after removing ERTMS as a variant for class-B signals].
* Fixed bug in LuaExpresssion call to NOBN_sig_getSignalPartNames() DNA function from [JBTSA_SIG Signal].IsyPostnotat [missing parenthesis].
* Fixed bug in Lua functions NOBN_sig_getSignalLitra() and NOBN_sig_getSignalLitra() concerning signal object's code property being 'nil'.
* Fixed bad name for function _JBTSA_SIG_signal_model3DName().
* Fixed bad linking of Lua expression for ERTMS ID boards, property Offset3D.Z to the object type.
* Changed the Text Attribute tags in 3D models for ERTMS ID-board E101-E and E101-F from T01 to T04.
* Changed _JBTSA_MSS_E101_Offset3dZ() to use attachment parent's Yokemounted property if possible.
* Fixed issues concerning bad balise relations and function _JBTSA_ATC_code().
* Fixed Model3DName formula for JBTSA_ATB legacy balises (NSS, National Signaling System).
* Fixed routing of text to 2D balise symbol from properties TextAbove / TextUnder to the ATTDEF properties 'TEKSTOVER' and 'TEKSTUNDER'.
* Resolved duplicate relation names between ETCS and NSS balise group and related objects.
* Fixed error in 'JBTSA_SPF Sporfelt' - French text has been replaced, delimiter object type has been corrected to "JBTKO_SKJ Skinneskjøt".
+ Added multiple prefab cable lengths to axle counter tuning unit, adjusted the model check formula accordingly. Added flat/upright/wall as its mounting methods.
+ Added 3D models for flat / upright wallmount of "JBTSA_TET Akselteller" tuning unit (type Thales)
* Relation source name for axle counter tuning unit changed from just 'tuningenhet' to 'akselteller_tuningenhet'
* Connected flat / upright / wallmount FTGS tuning units to new object type "JBTSA_SGT Tuningenhet for FTGS sporfelt"
* Fixed error in 3D model for switch point machines (it selected left side "VSIDE" consequently)
+ Added field 'Banestrekning' to 'Tittelfelt' property set
* Modified 3D models for "Kabelkanal" so the insertion point is on the top of the lid rather than at the bottom of the models.

RailCOMPLETE DNA version NO-BN 2022.a
++ Great news!     + Added     - Removed     * Modified     ? Known problem     ! Info
* Fixed bug in _JBTEH_MAS_SpanLengthDisplay2() [np2 => npo2].
* Fixed bug in _JBTSA_SIG_signal_model3DName() [after removing ERTMS as a variant for class-B signals].
* Fixed bug in LuaExpresssion call to NOBN_sig_getSignalPartNames() DNA function from [JBTSA_SIG Signal].IsyPostnotat [missing parenthesis].
* Fixed bug in Lua functions NOBN_sig_getSignalLitra() and NOBN_sig_getSignalLitra() concerning signal object's code property being 'nil'.
* Fixed bad name for function _JBTSA_SIG_signal_model3DName().
* Fixed bad linking of Lua expression for ERTMS ID boards, property Offset3D.Z to the object type.
* Changed the Text Attribute tags in 3D models for ERTMS ID-board E101-E and E101-F from T01 to T04.
* Changed _JBTSA_MSS_E101_Offset3dZ() to use attachment parent's Yokemounted property if possible.
* Fixed issues concerning bad balise relations and bad function _JBTSA_ATC_code().
* Fixed Model3DName formula for JBTSA_ATB legacy balises (NSS, National Signaling System).
* Fixed routing of text to 2D balise symbol from properties TextAbove / TextUnder to the ATTDEF properties 'TEKSTOVER' and 'TEKSTUNDER'.
* Resolved duplicate relation names between ETCS and NSS balise group and related objects.
* Fixed error in 'JBTSA_SPF Sporfelt' - French text has been replaced, delimiter object type has been corrected to "JBTKO_SKJ Skinneskjøt".
+ Added multiple prefab cable lengths to axle counter tuning unit, adjusted the model check formula accordingly. Added flat/upright/wall as its mounting methods.
+ Added 3D models for flat / upright wallmount of "JBTSA_TET Akselteller" tuning unit (type Thales)
* Relation source name for axle counter tuning unit changed from just 'tuningenhet' to 'akselteller_tuningenhet'
* Connected flat / upright / wallmount FTGS tuning units to new object type "JBTSA_SFT Tuningenhet for FTGS sporfelt"
* Fixed error in 3D model for switch point machines (it selected left side "VSIDE" consequently)
+ Added field 'Banestrekning' to 'Tittelfelt' Bane NOR property set
* Modified 3D models for "Kabelkanal" so the insertion point is centric on the top of the lid rather than centric at the bottom of the models.
* Changed 'Bæretråd' to 'Bæreline'
+ Introduced "Kontaktledning, wire" as a new variant for "JBTEH_KTL Kontaktledning". The new continuation item for CW will piece them together from one end (at
  the first wire tension balancer) to the other end (at the second WTB). A correctly configured contact wire will start out as a steel wire
  (dashed line type), continue as a lifted (grooved but non-contact) contact wire (dashed linetype), continue as a grooved contact wire (continuous linetype),
  then continue as a lifed contact wire (dashed linetype) and finally as a steel wire to the second wire tension balancer.
- Deprecated "Bæreline" as a variant of KBTEH_KTL contact wire.
- Messenger wires, droppers, stich lines, Z-lines are not anymore modeled as semantic objects with RcType. Semantic info should be contained in cantilevers instead.
+ Introduced "JBTEH_FIL Fixline" as a new alignment type. Its relation source space is 'fixline'. It relates to one cantilever, two wire tension balancers, 
  and zero, one or two force transfer consoles 'JBTEH_KPM' (no KPM at a TUF tunnel wall fixation, use KPM if terminated at an OCS mast). It accepts line
  isolators. It does not accept continuation objects, it shall be drawn from end to between its two wire tension balancers.
* Relation "Utliggerfiksering" now has "fixline" as target space instead of "kl-oppheng".
* The former "Har kl-oppheng" forward relation is now replaced by the forward relation "Fikseres av fixline" / reverse relation "Fikserer utligger".
* JBTEH_ISO now snaps to alignment types 'JBTEH_KTL Kontaktledning' and to 'JBTEH_FIL Fixline'.
- Point object JBTEH_AEH does not have variant 'Fixpunkt' anymore.
* 'JBTEH_AEH Avspenning' now snaps to these relation source spaces: kontaktledning/fixline/høyspentledning.
+ Point object 'JBTEH_FIX Fixpunkt' has been added, snapping to 'JBTEH_KTL Kontaktledning'.
* Changed 'JBTEH_XBE Beskyttelsesskjerm' into 'JBTEH_ASK Avskjerming'. All associated 2D symbols and 3D files have been renamed accordingly.
* Changed 'JBTEH_KPM Konsoll på mast' into 'JBTEH_KPM Kraftoverføringskonsoll på mast'.
* Changed all 'FE-Div Xxx' RcTypes into 'JBTFE_DIV Xxx'.
* Updated the OCS support mast table
* Fixed many smaller issues concerning Lua formulas for name, code, DistanceToAlignment, RelativeElevation properties which were declared in XML macros as well 
  as directly in XML code.
+ New object type 'JBTEH_LED Ledning'. Various wires for OCS wire system.
+ New object type 'JBTEH_LEF Ledningsfortsettelse'. Continuation for 'JBTEH_LED Ledning'.
+ New object type 'JBTEH_KTF Ledningsfortsettelse'. Continuation for 'JBTEH_KTL Kontaktledning'.
* Refined Lua snippet for property JBTEH_UTL.code, it now copies the mast's code. If two or more cantilevers, it assigns a sub-numbering -1, -2 etc.
* Refined Lua snippet for property JBTEH_AEH.Mileage, it now rotates and snaps to the extremity of its stretcher / spanner alignment.
* Refined Lua snippet for property JBTEH_FIL.TargetAlignment and JBTEH_KTF.TargetAlignment, they now locate a best guess target alignment.
* Fixed a DistanceToAlignment problem for JBTEH_UTL cantilever objects when it did not belong to the same track as its OCS mast.

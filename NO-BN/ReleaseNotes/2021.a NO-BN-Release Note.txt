* Table filters written in Lua: The filter's Lua code will now treat 'nil' and 'false' as false and anything else as 'true'. Previous RC versions accepted only 'true' as true.
* Bugs: Many bugs have been removed. And some new ones have certainly been introduced  - please notice support@railcomplete.com if something is strange or bad. Remember to save often when using beta software!
* Updated drawing of transients from point objects to alignment.
+ Added new functions displaySightBeam and displaySightVolume. Display sight beam creates a "sight beam" from a source train window towards a targeted sign. Display sight volume incrementally creates several such beams, and by that creating a volume in 3D showcaing possible interfering obstacles.

- Removed relation lines corresponding to track connection objects.
* Changed selection of PVI types in the vertical tab of the alignment manager to use a drop down menu.
+ Added DNA controlled settings to control fouling point behaviour.
* Menus of the type used in RC-DisplayEnvelope now use async checking to update save button.
+ RC-DisplaySightVolume, RC-DisplaySightBeam, RC-DisplaySightArea and RC-DisplaySightLine have been gathered into one single command: Rc-DisplaySighting. The command has a options menu where color, transparency or other sighing related parameters can be specified.

;
;=========================================================================================================================
;
; Main LISP file for generating Bane NOR 2D symbol library for use with RailCOMPLETE.
;
; This file may well be called from a script, "GenerateSymbolLibrary.scr" run under AutoCAD from a batch file.
; See scripts and batchfiles under Github\RailCOMPLETE\Customization\_TOOLBOX...
;
; See also the DebugHelpers.lsp file contained in the 2D\_SRC folder.
;
; IMPORTANT NOTES on AutoLISP intricacies:
; 
; 1)
; Integer division such as (/ 3 2) returns 1, whereas (/ 3 2.0) and (/ 3.0 2) and (/ 3.0 2.0) return 1.5
;
; 2)
; Note: Unicode hex 'nnnn' is '\U+nnnn' in AutoCAD text - but in later versions (2019) of AutoCAD, non-English characters don't work at all. 
; Use globals defined in the global-constant file, with (eval (strcat "Skj" _oe_ "testykke")) where you need to use the combined string.
;
; We cannot use special national characters in folder names in a 'findfile' Visual LISP command.
; It also appears that Windows substitutes 'oe' for Scandinavian 'Ã¸' in folder names without telling - so
; avoid 'oe' as well (in folder names). (Discovered 2020-04-06 by CLFEY on Norconsult PC.)
;
; 3)
; AutoLISP ignores overloaded commands when a dot "." precedes the command name, e.g. .MOVE
;
; 4)
; AutoLISP interprets the command and its parameters according to the US-EN locale when an underscore '_' precedes the command name or attribute name.
;
; 5) 
; Subcommand names such as "Justify" in the ATTDEF command will lead to an error, write only "J" (or better, "_J") and you're fine when writing LISP.
; This is NOT very consequently programmed in AutoLISP, since for instance '(command "._MOVE" "_ALL" "" "0,0" "0,1")' (move everything right by 1 unit) 
; accepts both the unique abbreviation "AL" ("_AL") and the full text "ALL" ("_ALL"). 
; But (command "._ATTDEF" "" "tagname" "prompt" "default_text" "Justify" "_MC" "0,0" 3.5 0) (middle center adjustment at (0,0) with 3.5 high letters, 
; 0 deg rotation) does NOT work. The ATTDEF command requires you to use ONLY the letters that are highlighted when using the command-line version 
; command, i.e. "J" ("_J") instead of "Justify" ("_Justify"). Same goes for '"ARC" "CE"...' which works, but '"ARC" "CEnter"...' does NOT work.
;
; 6)
;  LISP function names must contain at least one letter.

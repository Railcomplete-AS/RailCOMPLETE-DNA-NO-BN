				<Question>What is Bane NOR?</Question>
				<Answer>Bane NOR (*) is Norway's national railway administration. Bane NOR changed its original name from NSB (Norges Statsbaner) to JBV (Jernbaneverket) when the EU directive 48/96 was ratified, and later into Bane NOR when the Jernbanedirektoratet directorate function was fissioned out. Bane NOR owns, regulates, operates and maintains the normal gauge network, except for industrial sidings and a few museum lines. The network comprises about 4000 km of line, where 150 km is double track around the capital Oslo and about 2400 km are elctrified. Please verify these figures on Bane NOR's official page www.banenor.no, or at Wikipedia.

(*) Bane NOR has been nicknamed "NO-BN" in RailCOMPLETE.

Release notes. We use these symbols to show changes to features:
+          Added
-           Removed
*           Modified
?           Known problem

*   New and more responsive Help-system

+  Added ‘flashbox’ pop-up speech bubbles giving quick transient feedback, or warning about improperly set system variables.

*   ‘DNA’ – Definition of Network Assets – replaces the now deprecated notion of ‘OTD’ – Object Type Definitions.

+  Added supervision of DNA version discrepancies between the drawing being edited and its Xref’ed drawings.

*   The ‘Position’ and the ‘Show Relation Lines’ tools are now toggled off by double-clicking on the ribbon icons.

*   Corrected some seldomly occurring errors in Mileage/ReferenceMileage calculations when moving objects

*   Modified the user interfaces for the MoveSelectionAlongPath and CopySelectionAongPath commands

+  CreatePointObject now accepts ‘a’ for toggling docking to alignment, and ‘p’ for docking to point objects (use depends on DNA).

+  CreatePointObject can now offer pre-defined display points for snapping signs and boards’ displaypoints during creation. 

*   Many Tooltips have been added or improved: 9 x 3D preview angles, ‘family portrait’ for 3D-preview of objects which are attached among them as a connected ‘family’, braking curve calculations, distances, alignment info.

*   Corrected many flaws in handling of object ‘tails’, i.e. the angled tail for boards and poles, when changing the object’s direction or side of alignment, or when attaching the object to another object

+  CreateAlignment has substantial improvements, it can now draw clothoids, define start/end directions etc.

+  CreateAlignment now shows annotated alignment while drawing, as visual feedback

*   ‘Line/Arc/Clothoid‘ have been renamed ‘Tangent/Curve/Spiral’ in Alignment Manager and in CreateAlignment

*   Improved accuracy in the AssistCreateConnectionObjects algorithm, leading to fewer incorrect crossings etc.

+  Many keyboard shortcuts added to Property Manager and Object Manager. Just try it!

+  Added numerous new menu choices in right-click menu for Object Manager and Alignment Manager

+  Double-clicking on an object now opens the Property Manager window

+  F3 opens Lua editor directly (F2 edits cell, F1 opens Help)

+  Cells (properties) in Object Manager or Property Manager that cannot be edited because they are bound by another cell’s formula (e.g. Mileage cannot be edited if ReferenceMileage already has a formula), are show with a padlock

+  Objects which cannot be edited because they reside in an XREFfed drawing, are greyed down in Object Manager and shown with n ‘Xref’ icon in Property Manager

+  Added quick command Export3D to right-click menus in modelspace

*   Many improvements to 3D Export menus

+  Added logging of 3D export settings to the log file

*   Corrected earlier flaws in 3D export log message

*   Mileage/ReferenceMileage annotations in 3D export now show up for integer multiples of the given repetition distance

*   Improved Name Builder for Export 3D file autonaming feature

+  Export 3D library path has been extended to a list of search paths

*   Improved AssistCreateInterlockingTables functionality

+  The ATC2 braking curve tool now prints deceleration speeds along the braking curve, for every 5 km/h.

*   Improved model checking for many object types

+  Most tools can now distinguish between visible and non-visible objects

+  ManageStagesUsingLayerNames now support color-coding in layouts of changes between two stages

*   Improved auditing of alignments

*   Many improvements in EditProperty

+  Automatic recognition of relations that have changed name when loading a new DNA, with support for salvaging data.

+  Added DNA validation tool

*   Improved license handling

*   New datagrid and improved user interface in Alignment Manager, copy-paste, TAB-sequence etc.

*   Changed internal representation of alignments from LandXML to proprietary ‘RC’ data format. Does not affect LandXML import/export.

*   Improved user interface for import/export of alignments – sorting, formulas for naming.

+  Xref’ed alignmens are greyed out in Alignment Manager

+  Added many new getXxxxYyyyy() functions, callable from Lua code

+  Lua custom functions can now be defined in DNA without their contents being visible to the ordinary user, i.e. being more ‘tamper-proof’ and placing the commonly used code in the DNA (which can be uploaded and changed) and not directly in each object (which would require changing lots of formulas in object XML)

+  Added extensive control over custom text attribute items using the EditTextAttributes command

+  Texts can now be moved as a group for one or several objects using the MoveTextAttribute command

-   Beta version tools such as AssistCreateSchematicDrawing and AssistCreateAlignmentUsingRegression have been hidden for normal ‘User’ licenses. We will introduce them when they are mature.’

?   AutoCAD often crashes when switching between a 2D drawing and a heavy 3D drawing. Run AutoCAD in two different sessions to circumvent this problem.
